BirstConnect_Command
====================

Ruby script used to generalize running Birst commands.

Don't use this, it's still in very early stages of development.


ToDo:

* Intent - bare bones ruby and CL interface to Birst
* Basic usage examples (take from test)
* Explanation of camelcase
* Helper functions
